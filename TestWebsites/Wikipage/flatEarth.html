        <p>
            The myth of round earth has been circulating for 
            centuries. The flat Earth theory is the belief 
            that the Earth is flat rather than an oblate 
            spheroid (fig. 1). Proponents argue that the Earth appears 
            flat to the observer and that traditional physics
            and astronomy are part of a conspiracy to hide 
            the truth. Satellite images and space missions 
            are often faked (fig. 2). As part of Barack Obama's 
            collaboration with the deep state, much fake
            evidence has been planted to mislead the public.
